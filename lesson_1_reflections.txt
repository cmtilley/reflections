How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
This was all a good refresher and 
an opportunity to learn a few new tools.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It makes it easier to correct unintended errors.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Pro's: you have more controll
Con's: you risk losing your work if you forget and the computer crashes

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I don't know :)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git Log provides the list of commits and descriptions of changes between each
Git diff, when provided two commit ids as arguments provides the differences between the two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Knowing that you can always roll back to the previous commit helps

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Coding ..
